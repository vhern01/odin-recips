    </ol>
    <h4>How to make the burrito</h4>
    <p>You heat the tortilla on a pan that it fits on and then u add rice & beans inside. And then fold it how you fold a burrito and heat it on the pan a bit more and then eat it. Your  burrito will look exactly like the one in the photo. If it does not looks like that one. im sorry.
